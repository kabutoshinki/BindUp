        comment: "I switched from Weebly to WebWave and have used this platform to design and host over 45 websites with new websites being added each month. The website editor works differently to anything else on the market and gives me the confidence to take on just about any project for small to medium business clients. Global delivery is powered by the KeyCDN network and VPS servers in Australia and USA facilitate a fast, fully hosted solution for any web designer or digital agency looking for a solid white label design platform. New design features are added just about every month. Combine all of this with super responsive online support and you can forget the rest. WebWave is the real deal.",

        comment: "All in all, probably the best website builder for graphic designers. Having a beautiful website no longer a nightmare for website developers. Loading speed also increased dramatically. Truly the best builder I've ever used in my career hands down.",
